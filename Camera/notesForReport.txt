Cant use PRi.GPIO library for PWM as it only generates a software pwm which doesnt at ll run optimally in python on a pi resulting in jitter in the servos because of inconsistent control signal. Instead using pigpio with a servo function generates a hardware pwm with a frequency of 50 hz where a positive pulse width can be specified, this gives a consistent control signal for the servos
